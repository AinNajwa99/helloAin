<br>Hello, it's me
<br>I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
<br>To go over everything
<br>They say that time's supposed to heal ya
<br>But I ain't done much healing
<br>Hello, can you hear me?
<br>I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
<br>When we were younger and free
<br>I've forgotten how it felt
<br>Before the world fell at our feet
<br>
<br>There's such a difference between us
<br>And a million miles
<br>
<br>Hello from the other side
<br>I must have called a thousand times
<br>To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
<br>But when I call you never seem to be home
<br>Hello from the outside
<br>At least I can say that I've tried
<br>To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
<br>But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
<br>Anymore
<br>
<br>Hello, how are you?
<br>It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
<br>I hope that you're well
<br>Did you ever make it out of that town
<br>Where nothing ever happened?
<br>
<br>It's no secret that the both of us
<br>Are running out of time
<br>
<br>So hello from the other side (other side)
<br>I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
<br>To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
<br>But when I call you never seem to be home
<br>Hello from the outside (outside)
<br>At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
<br>To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
<br>But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
<br>Anymore

<br>I found a love for me
<br>Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
<br>Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
<br>Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
<br>
<br>'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
<br>Not knowing what it was
<br>I will not give you up this time
<br>But darling, just kiss me slow
<br>Your heart is all I own
<br>And in your eyes you're holding mine
<br>
<br>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
<br>With you between my arms
<br>Barefoot on the grass
<br>Listening to our favourite song
<br>When you said you looked a mess
<br>I whispered underneath my breath
<br>But you heard it,
<br>Darling, you look perfect tonight
<br>
<br>Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
<br>She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
<br>I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
<br>To carry love, to carry children of our own

<br>We are still kids but we're so in love
<br>Fighting against all odds
<br>I know we'll be alright this time
<br>Darling, just hold my hand
<br>Be my girl, I'll be your man
<br>I see my future in your eyes
<br>
<br>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
<br>With you between my arms
<br>Barefoot on the grass
<br>Listening to our favourite song
<br>When I saw you in that dress
<br>Looking so beautiful
<br>I don't deserve this
<br>Darling, you look perfect tonight
<br>
<br>No, no, no
<br>
<br>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
<br>With you between my arms
<br>Barefoot on the grass
<br>Listening to our favourite song
<br>I have faith in what I see
<br>Now I know I have met an angel in person
<br>And she looks perfect
<br>I don't deserve this
<br>You look perfect tonight

<br>You and me, we made a vow
<br>For better or for worse
<br>I can't believe you let me down
<br>But the proof's in the way it hurts
<br>
<br>For months on end I've had my doubts
<br>Denying every tear
<br>I wish this would be over now
<br>But I know that I still need you here
<br>
<br>You say I'm crazy
<br>'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
<br>But when you call me baby
<br>I know I'm not the only one
<br>
<br>You've been so unavailable
<br>Now sadly I know why
<br>Your heart is unobtainable
<br>Even though Lord knows you kept mine
<br>
<br>You say I'm crazy
<br>'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
<br>But when you call me baby
<br>I know I'm not the only one
<br>
<br>I have loved you for many years
<br>Maybe I am just not enough
<br>You've made me realize my deepest fear
<br>By lying and tearing us up
<br>
<br>You say I'm crazy
<br>'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
<br>But when you call me baby
<br>I know I'm not the only one
<br>
<br>You say I'm crazy

<br>And I know
<br>And I know

<br>The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
<br>And I'm a house of cards
<br>You're the kind of reckless
<br>That should send me runnin'
<br>But I kinda know that I won't get far
<br>And you stood there in front of me
<br>Just close enough to touch
<br>Close enough to hope you couldn't see
<br>What I was thinking of
<br>
<br>Drop everything now
<br>Meet me in the pouring rain
<br>Kiss me on the sidewalk
<br>Take away the pain
<br>'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
<br>Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
<br>Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
<br>'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
<br>
<br>My mind forgets to remind me
<br>You're a bad idea
<br> touch me once and it's really something,
<br>You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
<br>I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
<br>But with you I know it's no good
<br>And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...
<br>
<br>Drop everything now
<br>Meet me in the pouring rain
<br>Kiss me on the sidewalk
<br>Take away the pain
<br>'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
<br>Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
<br>Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
<br>'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
<br>
<br>I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
<br>Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
<br>And lead me up the staircase
<br>Won't you whisper soft and slow?
<br>I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.
<br>
<br>Drop everything now,
<br>Meet me in the pouring rain,
<br>Kiss me on the sidewalk,
<br>Take away the pain
<br>'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
<br>Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
<br>Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
<br>'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
<br>
<br>And the sparks fly...
<br>Oh, baby, smile...
<br>And the sparks fly...
